Built a predictive model to determine the
likelihood of survival for passengers on
the Titanic using data science techniques
in Python.
Abstract:

Titanic survival prediction is a classic machine learning task that involves predicting the likelihood of passengers surviving the sinking of the RMS Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and presence of family members. This dataset has garnered significant interest in the data science community due to its historical significance and rich set of attributes. Predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset typically employs a variety of machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. These algorithms are trained on a portion of the dataset with known outcomes (i.e., survival or non-survival) and evaluated on another portion to assess their predictive performance. The goal of this task is to build models that can accurately predict survival outcomes for passengers, thereby shedding light on the factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster. Such predictive models not only provide insights into historical events but also serve as valuable learning resources for studying machine learning techniques and their applications to real-world datasets. Through the analysis of Titanic survival prediction, researchers and data enthusiasts can gain practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, thus enhancing their skills in predictive analytics and data-driven decision-making.
